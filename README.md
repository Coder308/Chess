# Chess
A simple game of chess

This game of chess that I developed is simply a little training for me the get used to the javax.swing packages and to learn how to utilise them properly.

I used the images folder in eclipse as a source folder. Therefore the import of the images in the classes that implement chess pieces has to be changed depending on if you don't mark the images folder as a source folder in eclipse.

The game isn't fully finished and it just works in the IDE Eclipse. I am still not able to create a runnable jar file and as long as this isn't possible, there won't be a finished game to play
