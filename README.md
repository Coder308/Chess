# Chess
A simple game of chess

This game of chess that I developed is simply a little training for me the get used to the javax.swing packages and to learn how to utilise them properly.

I used the images folder in eclipse as a source folder. Therefore the import of the images in the classes that implement chess pieces has to be changed depending on if you don't mark the images folder as a source folder in eclipse.

The game is still not fully developed, because right now is just possible to move the chess pieces, but there are no active rules implemented.
