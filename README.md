# Chess
A simple game of chess

This game of chess that I developed is simply a little training for me the get used to the javax.swing packages and to learn how to utilise them properly.

I used the images folder in eclipse as a source folder. Therefore the import of the images in the classes that implement chess pieces has to be changed depending on if you don't mark the images folder as a source folder in eclipse.

I finally made it possible to make a runnable jar file. It will be possible to play the finished game even without using the IDE.

The game is fully finished now and it should be no different from any real chess game considering that I implemented every rule that is needed. It might not look really good, but it is still a fully fleshed out game of chess.
