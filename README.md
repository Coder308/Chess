# Chess
A simple game of chess

This game of chess that I developed is simply a little training for me the get used to the javax.swing packages and to learn how to utilise them properly.

I used the images folder in eclipse as a source folder. Therefore the import of the images in the classes that implement chess pieces has to be changed depending on if you don't mark the images folder as a source folder in eclipse.

I finally made it possible to make a runnable jar file. It will be possible to play the finished game even without using the IDE. There are still some changes that need to be made, because I still haven't included a win condition that stops the game. I will do that soon.
